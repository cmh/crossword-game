# The Crossword Game

This is an implementation of an old game my family traditionally plays at Christmas time. 
The rules are simple but the tree of possible moves is huge, brute force is impossible, so clever solutions should be interesting to write. 
I have included one implementation of AI, and the ability to play as a human. 
Let me know if you are interested in writing some strategies, it could be interesting to have a small contest.

N.B A decent human score is around 30

See HowToPlay.md for the full 'rules' of the game:
