The Crossword Game

This is an implementation of an old game my family traditionally plays at Christmas time. The rules are simple but the strategy appears to be complex, and I would like to understand it better. This implementation is complete with several strategies, but please try and improve them or come up with completely new ones. Let me know if you have interest in organising a "tournament" :)

N.B A decent human score is around 30

The Rules

Each player starts with a blank 5x5 grid

All players must place this letter into their grid
Repeat this, moving through each player in a clockwise direction until there is one space remaining
All players fill the remaining space in their grid with a letter of their choice.

The winner is the player with the highest score.
